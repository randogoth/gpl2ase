GIMP .gpl to Adobe .ase palette converter

GIMP is free software anyone can use, Adobe Photoshop not so much.

This converter was written for converting GIMP .gpl palettes to Adobe .ase palettes, for various reasons:
 - Sharing custom palettes created in GIMP with those who use Photoshop as their daily driver.
 - converting custom .gpl palettes to .ase for importing into blender for texture painting
 - Any other .ase need anyone might have

The converter supports up to 2048 colors in a palette (way more than enough for pixelart)
